            <p>
                So you've decided you want to play an instrument, and want to know where to go from here. Hopefully the following steps can
                give you a good idea of where to start.
            </p>

            <div id="step1">
                <div class="gsImage">
                    <img class="startImage" src="Images/instruments.svg" />
                </div>
                1) Decide which instrument you want to play. Don't be afraid to try a few different instruments. It's hard to make a concrete
                decision about how much you enjoy a particular instrument until you've played around with it for a little while. It is also
                incredibly hard to recommend an instrument that you haven't physically played.
            </div>

            <div id="step2">
                <div class="gsImage">
                    <img class="startImage" src="Images/old-3676542_1920.jpg" />
                </div>
                2) Get your hands on your instrument of choice. Unfortunately, musical instruments can be very expensive. Don't be deterred from
                picking up a low budget imitation, or something second hand. Although the sound quality of the cheaper options is likely to be poor, they are great for
                a beginner practising the basics of how to operate the instrument, and there are many techniques you can learn and master on cheap
                instruments before you move on to a more professional option. Sometimes cheap instruments are sought after by even professional
                musicians, as they have qualities that can't be found elsewhere, and if you have the patience and are willing to experiment, you
                can end up achieving a unique sound.
            </div>

            <div id="step3">
                <div class="gsImage">
                    <img class="startImage" src="Images/Greensleeves_Dorian_mode_version_sheet_music_02.png" />
                </div>
                3) Learn. There are an incredible number of resources available for every level of musicianship, from the absolute basics to the
                most complicated techniques possible. Probably the most effective method for learning an instrument is to have one-on-one teaching
                with a professional, so if this is within your means, it is highly recommended. Don't discount other avenues as a primary source
                of knowledge, or a supplement to your lessons, however. YouTube is home to a huge variety of free lessons for almost any topic.
                Learning from books would also be useful, but most of your learning is going to come from hearing other people play and trying to
                imitate their techniques.
            </div>

            <div id="step4">
                <div class="gsImage">
                    <img class="startImage" src="Images/D'Anglebert-Bach.png" />
                </div>
                4) Practice. You will hear this often. Practice is the number one most important thing you can ever do to get the most out of
                playing an instrument. Many people who start playing an instrument are disappointed that they can't get immediate results. It does
                take a lot of time and effort to become proficient in the basics, and the time spent here can be frustrating and tiring. But your
                dedication will be rewarded when you can finally play what you want, when and how you want to.
            </div>

            <div id="step5">
                <div class="gsImage">
                    <img class="startImage" src="Images/band-1595310_1920.png" />
                </div>
                5) Find other people to play with. This doesn't apply to all instruments and styles, but many forms of music can have a whole new
                dynamic when played with other people. Once you have found people that you are comfortable playing with, you can explore different
                opportunities compared to what you are restricted to playing alone. There is a huge sense of achievement when you perform with
                like minded musicians, and the different perspectivies offered by other people allow for endless possibilities.
            </div>

            <div id="step6">
                <div class="gsImage">
                    <img class="startImage" src="Images/Astronaut-in-space.jpg" />
                </div>
                6) Experiment. Once you've reached a place where you are comfortable playing, either by yourself or with other people, and are
                somewhat satisfied with your ability, you can work on pushing the boundaries of yourself, your playing, and the music itself.
                There are always new horizons to explore.
