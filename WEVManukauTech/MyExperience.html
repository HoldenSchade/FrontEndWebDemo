                    My name is Holden. I am 28 years old. I play guitar, I'm in a band, I record and produce my own music, and I play music for
                    fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Music for me is life's greatest pleasure. There are few moments in life where I am not experiencing music in some way.
                    Preferring to keep to myself, music is the ultimate company. Listening to music that I enjoy gives me sensational
                    experiences that cannot be replicated by anything else. When I'm feeling bad, music is there to lift me up. When I'm feeling
                    good, music is there to celebrate with me. I am constantly in awe of the incredible talent of artists from around the world
                    who are able to create vivid soundscapes that portray such emotion and meaning, often without even the use of spoken
                    language.

                    I began playing music as a child, but never had the attention or patience to sit down and learn how to play properly.
                    Eventually I found myself sitting in my room with nothing else to do, and decided to try and learn how to play some of my
                    favourite songs on guitar. It was an arduous process, and by no means am I an expert still, but the experience of finally
                    being able to create something that I can be proud of is beyond the scope of what I can put into words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been incredibly fortunate to have this passion for music. I can't imagine what kind of meaning my life would have if
                    I didn't. And I am very lucky to be able to share this passion with like-minded people. Collaborating with other people to
                    create music together has been some of the most wonderful experiences I have ever had.
