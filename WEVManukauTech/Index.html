                    Have you ever felt like you were missing something in your life? That there was no fire burning in your heart,
                    and no passion pulsing through your veins? Perhaps you feel bored and lifeless, envious of those around you who seem to
                    have such drive and purpose?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or maybe you were listening to the radio one day, and a song caught your ear, leaving you feeling a sense of joy and
                    excitement that you hadn't yet experienced?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you ever watched someone playing an instrument, and thought "That looks pretty cool! Maybe I should try it one day?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or maybe somebody on the internet thinks that just because he likes playing guitar won't stop telling you how great it is
                    and that you'd be wasting your life if you didn't try it for yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whatever the case may be, you've stumbled upon what I hope will be a guide that will help you decide whether you want to learn
                    an instrument, and how best to get started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And to anyone who has already found their passion, I hope you at least find some amusement in these pages.
