                        What is sound?

                        Sound is defined as a continuous variation in pressure of a medium.
                        Sound that is perceivable by humans ranges from between 20Hz and 20kHz (these numbers are explained in more detail below).
                        Although not audible to humans, sound does exist outside of this range. The medium can be any matter that is able to
                        vibrate at a consistent frequency, but human hearing is most efficient when the medium is air (i.e. humans hear things
                        most clearly when listening to sound within the Earth’s atmosphere). Sound is unable to travel through a vacuum and is
                        therefore unable to be transmitted directly through outer space.

                        What is pitch?

                    <p>
                        Musical instruments can be divided into two main categories: Pitched and Unpitched. Pitched instruments, such as guitar,
                        piano, or saxophone, create sounds that have clearly defined pitch corresponding with the frequency of vibrations that
                        are created by the instrument. Atonal instruments, such as most drums and cymbals, create sounds that either do not have
                        a clearly defined pitch or are not related to the pitches of other instruments that they play along with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term “pitch” itself refers to the frequency at which sonic waves are transmitted through a medium. It is academically
                        referred to as “pitch” or “tone”, and is represented in Hertz (Hz), and has direct correlations to musical notes and tones.
                        When plotted on a graph with air pressure on the y axis and time on the x axis, sound waves propagate in cycles following
                        a sine wave curve (in the case of a pure tone). 1Hz is equivalent to 1 cycle per second, meaning
                        that the pressure of a medium will rise to its maximum point, fall to its minimum point, and return to its starting point
                        within the span of 1 second.

                        Essentially, higher frequency sounds are fast moving waves, and lower frequency sounds are slow moving waves.

                        What is volume?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When somebody mentions volume in relation to sound, usually they are actually referring to the loudness of a
                        sound rather than a physical measure of the volume of matter. The loudness of a sound is proportional to the
                        change in level of pressure of a medium in response to a sound wave. Plotted on a graph, the loudness of a sound
                        can be determined by the height of the wave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Loudness is measured in decibels (dB) when comparing two or more different sounds, but this is not an objective
                        measurement. There have been attempts to categorise levels of loudness, and although no one measurement system
                        has been universally standardised, objective loudness is usually measured in decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL).

                    <p>
                        The louder a sound is, the greater the displacement of its medium. Quiet sounds will displace a medium to a much
                        smaller degree.

                    How does this relate to music?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The loudness and frequency of sounds can be adjusted, combined, separated, duplicated, transposed, restricted,
                    and layered to create a potentially limitless variety of different sounds. Human auditory reception to sound
                    follows exponential relationships, both in response to loudness and frequency. For instance, human frequency
                    hearing ranges from 20Hz to 20kHz. A sound played at 100Hz will be perceived by a person as a particular note.
                    A sound played at 200Hz will be perceived as the same note, but at a higher pitch. A sound played at 400Hz will
                    also be perceived as the same note, yet even higher. These notes are referred to as “Octaves” of each other in
                    musical theory, and the mathematical relationship between them serve as the basis for most musical theory. The
                    frequency of 440Hz is the primary international standard for the note A4, off which many
                    instruments can be tuned.
